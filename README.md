## Comprehensive CSPM for Your Cloudflare Environment

FlareGuard is a powerful, serverless CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) platform designed specifically for Cloudflare. It continuously scans your Cloudflare configurations for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance gaps, delivering actionable insights to strengthen your security posture.

**Why FlareGuard CSPM?**

- üîç **Complete Security Visibility** - Assess your entire Cloudflare environment from zones to Zero Trust
- üöÄ **Zero Infrastructure** - Runs entirely as a Cloudflare Worker with no backend servers
- üìä **Actionable Insights** - Get a security score and prioritized recommendations
- üîê **Compliance Ready** - Compare your settings against industry security standards
- üèÜ **NIST Mapped** - All findings mapped to NIST security controls
- üîÑ **Expandable Coverage** - Currently focused on zone security with roadmap for Zero Trust, Access, and more

## Current Status

FlareGuard CSPM is in active development. Our modular architecture allows us to expand security coverage across the Cloudflare ecosystem.

### What's Working

- ‚úÖ Zone security posture assessment
- ‚úÖ Real-time API integration for configuration analysis
- ‚úÖ Security scoring with compliance mapping
- ‚úÖ Detailed remediation guidance
- ‚úÖ NIST controls mapping

### On Our Roadmap (Community Contributions Welcome!)

- üöÄ Advanced zone security checks (WAF, Rate Limiting, DNSSEC, etc.)
- üöÄ Zero Trust security posture assessment
- üöÄ Multi-zone management for enterprise environments
- üöÄ Historical security posture tracking

See our detailed [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) file for our development plans and how you can contribute.

## Future Vision

Our vision for FlareGuard is to become the definitive CSPM platform for the entire Cloudflare ecosystem. Beyond zone security, we're building a comprehensive solution that provides security visibility across all Cloudflare services. Check out our [landing page mockup](./landing_page_update.html) to see the planned user interface with enhanced features.

### Planned Enhancements

- **Enterprise CSPM Dashboard** - Unified security view across all Cloudflare services
- **Multi-Service Coverage** - Expanding beyond zones to Zero Trust, Access, Pages, and more
- **Advanced Risk Scoring** - Sophisticated algorithms for precise security posture evaluation
- **Compliance Reporting** - Pre-built reports for common frameworks (NIST, ISO, CIS)
- **Automated Remediation** - One-click fixes for common security issues

We welcome community contributions to help make this vision a reality!

## How It Works

FlareGuard provides a simple workflow to audit your Cloudflare zone security settings. The screenshots below show the web interface in action.

> **Security Note:** When using FlareGuard or sharing screenshots, always redact sensitive information like Zone IDs, API tokens, and domain names. The screenshots below are examples only and should not contain real credentials.
> 
> **Important:** Before sharing any screenshots of your FlareGuard usage:
> 1. Redact or blur all Zone IDs (32-character hexadecimal strings)
> 2. Never include API tokens in screenshots
> 3. Consider redacting domain names if they're for internal or sensitive systems
> 4. Verify no sensitive information appears in the URL bar or browser tabs

### 1. Enter Credentials

Enter your Cloudflare Zone ID and API Token to begin the security audit.

![Step 1: Enter Credentials](docs/assets/1.png)

### 2. Run Audit

Run the security audit to evaluate your zone against security best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (for deployment)
- Node.js (v16+)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshadk99/flareguard.git
   cd flareguard
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Enter your Cloudflare Zone ID
2. Enter your Cloudflare API Token with appropriate permissions
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify credentials
4. Click "Run Audit" to analyze your zone

### Required API Token Permissions

Your Cloudflare API token needs these permissions:
- Zone Read
- SSL and Certificates Read

### Understanding Results

The audit provides results in several sections:
- **Summary** - Overall security score and statistics
- **Issue List** - Detailed findings sorted by severity
- **Remediation** - Specific recommendations to improve security

## Security & Privacy

**FlareGuard prioritizes your security and privacy:**

- No credentials or sensitive data are stored
- All processing happens at request time in the Cloudflare Worker
- API tokens are only used for the duration of the audit
- No data is logged or persisted after the audit completes
- Uses `type="password"` fields to protect token visibility

## Testing with Environment Variables

For local testing and development, you can use environment variables to securely store your Cloudflare credentials:

1. **Set up your environment variables**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:env
   ```
   This interactive script will prompt you for your Cloudflare Zone ID and API Token and store them in a `.env` file.

2. **Run the test with environment variables**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:env
   ```

The `.env` file is automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your credentials to the repository.
