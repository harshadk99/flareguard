# FlareGuard vs. Actual Verification Results Comparison

| Check ID | Check Name | Actual Value | Expected Value | Actual Status | FlareGuard Status | Match? |
|----------|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| CF-SSL-001 | SSL/TLS Encryption mode | full | strict | FAIL | FAIL | ✅ |
| CF-TLS-001 | Minimum TLS Version | 1.0 | 1.2 | FAIL | PASS | ❌ |
| CF-HTTPS-001 | Always Use HTTPS | on | on | PASS | PASS | ✅ |
| CF-TLS-002 | Opportunistic Encryption | on | on | PASS | FAIL | ❌ |
| CF-TLS-003 | TLS 1.3 | on | on | PASS | PASS | ✅ |
| CF-BROWSER-001 | Browser Integrity Check | on | on | PASS | PASS | ✅ |
| CF-EMAIL-001 | Email Obfuscation | on | on | PASS | PASS | ✅ |
| CF-CHALLENGE-001 | Security Level | medium | medium | PASS | PASS | ✅ |

## Discrepancies Found

We found 2 discrepancies between the actual API verification and the FlareGuard audit results:

1. **CF-TLS-001 (Minimum TLS Version)**
   - Actual: FAIL - Your zone has TLS 1.0 enabled, but the recommendation is TLS 1.2
   - FlareGuard: PASS - Incorrectly reported as passing

2. **CF-TLS-002 (Opportunistic Encryption)**
   - Actual: PASS - Your zone has Opportunistic Encryption enabled
   - FlareGuard: FAIL - Incorrectly reported as failing

## Security Recommendations

Based on the actual verification, here are the recommended actions:

1. **Upgrade SSL/TLS Mode (CF-SSL-001)**
   - Current setting: full
   - Recommended setting: strict
   - Location in dashboard: SSL/TLS > Overview
   - Severity: HIGH

2. **Increase Minimum TLS Version (CF-TLS-001)**
   - Current setting: 1.0
   - Recommended setting: 1.2
   - Location in dashboard: SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates
   - Severity: HIGH

## Other Checks (Not Verified via API)

These checks were not included in the API verification but may need attention based on the FlareGuard audit:

1. **HSTS (CF-HSTS-001)** - Likely needs to be enabled
2. **WAF Packages (CF-WAF-001)** - Need to be enabled
3. **Firewall Rules (CF-FIREWALL-001)** - Should be created
4. **DNSSEC (CF-DNSSEC-001)** - Should be enabled

## Next Steps

1. Address the HIGH severity issues first (SSL/TLS Mode and Minimum TLS Version)
2. Review and address the other recommended security improvements
3. Re-run the verification after making changes to confirm improvements
