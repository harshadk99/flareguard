# FlareGuard Expansion Roadmap

## Current Capabilities
- ✅ Basic zone security settings assessment (SSL/TLS, Security Level, etc.)
- ✅ Single zone evaluation
- ✅ Real-time API integration for core settings
- ✅ Security score calculation
- ✅ Basic remediation recommendations

## Community Development Opportunities

FlareGuard is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Below are the key areas where you can help expand the project's capabilities.

## Phase 1: Advanced Zone Security Checks

### Features to Add
- **WAF Evaluation**: Implement checks for WAF configuration and rule sets
- **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limiting rules are properly configured
- **DNSSEC**: Check if DNSSEC is enabled and properly configured
- **Bot Management**: Verify bot protection settings
- **Certificate Management**: Check certificate expiration and cipher suites
- **Country Blocking**: Verify geographic-based firewall rules

### Implementation Plan
1. Create helper functions for Cloudflare API calls
2. Implement each check as a separate function
3. Add remediation guidance for each check
4. Update the UI to display the new checks

### How You Can Contribute
- Pick one of the security checks to implement
- Create helper functions for API calls
- Write tests for the new checks
- Improve error handling and resilience

## Phase 2: Multi-Zone Support

### Features to Add
- **Zone listing endpoint**: Allow users to list all their zones
- **Bulk audit capability**: Run audits across multiple zones in one request
- **Comparative scoring**: Show which zones are most secure vs. least secure
- **Aggregated reporting**: Summary view across all zones
- **Batch remediation**: Identify common issues across zones for efficient fixes

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /zones` - List all zones the API token has access to
- `POST /audit/bulk` - Run audit across multiple/all zones
- `GET /dashboard/multi-zone` - Multi-zone dashboard view

### How You Can Contribute
- Implement zone listing functionality
- Design multi-zone dashboard UI
- Create bulk audit processing logic
- Develop comparative reporting features

## Phase 3: Zero Trust Evaluation

### Features to Add
- **Identity provider checks**: Verify secure IdP configuration
- **Device posture evaluation**: Check device posture requirements
- **Access policy evaluation**: Assess access policy security
- **Zero Trust network rules**: Evaluate network security rules
- **Authentication method checks**: Verify MFA and authentication strength
- **Session duration checks**: Evaluate session timeout settings

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /zerotrust/access/identity-providers` - Check IdP configurations
- `GET /zerotrust/access/apps` - Evaluate Access applications
- `GET /zerotrust/devices/posture` - Check device posture rules
- `GET /zerotrust/access/policies` - Evaluate access policies
- `POST /audit/zero-trust` - Run comprehensive Zero Trust audit

### Security Baselines to Add
- Minimum IdP security requirements
- Recommended device posture settings
- Access policy best practices
- Authentication strength guidelines

### How You Can Contribute
- Develop Zero Trust module structure
- Implement Access application checks
- Create identity provider evaluation logic
- Design Zero Trust security baseline YAML

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Dashboard & Reporting

### Features to Add
- **Executive summary**: High-level security posture across all services
- **Trend analysis**: Security score changes over time
- **Risk prioritization**: Weighted risk scoring based on impact
- **Compliance mapping**: Map findings to compliance frameworks
- **Scheduled audits**: Automatic periodic assessments
- **Export capabilities**: PDF/CSV reports for stakeholders

### Implementation Plan
1. Design expandable UI framework
2. Create modular reporting components
3. Implement data storage for historical tracking
4. Add compliance mapping database
5. Build scheduler for automated assessments

### How You Can Contribute
- Design improved dashboard UI
- Implement export functionality
- Create data visualization components
- Develop compliance mapping logic

## Technical Requirements
- Enhanced API token permissions (account-level access)
- Long-term storage for trend analysis
- Backend database for configuration history
- Improved authentication for the dashboard
- Rate limiting consideration for bulk operations
