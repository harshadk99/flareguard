# FlareGuard Expansion Roadmap

## Current Capabilities
- Basic zone security settings assessment (SSL/TLS, Security Level, etc.)
- Single zone evaluation
- Simulated data based on verified API calls
- Security score calculation
- Basic remediation recommendations

## Phase 1: Multi-Zone Support

### Features to Add
- **Zone listing endpoint**: Allow users to list all their zones
- **Bulk audit capability**: Run audits across multiple zones in one request
- **Comparative scoring**: Show which zones are most secure vs. least secure
- **Aggregated reporting**: Summary view across all zones
- **Batch remediation**: Identify common issues across zones for efficient fixes

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /zones` - List all zones the API token has access to
- `POST /audit/bulk` - Run audit across multiple/all zones
- `GET /dashboard/multi-zone` - Multi-zone dashboard view

## Phase 2: Zero Trust Evaluation

### Features to Add
- **Identity provider checks**: Verify secure IdP configuration
- **Device posture evaluation**: Check device posture requirements
- **Access policy evaluation**: Assess access policy security
- **Zero Trust network rules**: Evaluate network security rules
- **Authentication method checks**: Verify MFA and authentication strength
- **Session duration checks**: Evaluate session timeout settings

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /zeroteam/access/identity-providers` - Check IdP configurations
- `GET /zeroteam/access/apps` - Evaluate Access applications
- `GET /zeroteam/devices/posture` - Check device posture rules
- `GET /zeroteam/access/policies` - Evaluate access policies
- `POST /audit/zero-trust` - Run comprehensive Zero Trust audit

### Security Baselines to Add
- Minimum IdP security requirements
- Recommended device posture settings
- Access policy best practices
- Authentication strength guidelines

## Phase 3: Access App Security Assessment

### Features to Add
- **App inventory**: List all Access applications
- **Authentication evaluation**: Check authentication methods per app
- **Policy evaluation**: Assess each app's policy security
- **Least privilege checks**: Identify overly permissive policies
- **Session management**: Verify appropriate session settings
- **Identity risks**: Highlight potential identity vulnerabilities

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /zeroteam/access/apps` - List and evaluate Access apps
- `GET /zeroteam/access/apps/{app-id}/policies` - Evaluate app-specific policies
- `POST /audit/access-apps` - Audit Access apps specifically

### Security Baselines to Add
- Access app security benchmarks
- Policy templates for different sensitivity levels
- Session duration recommendations by app type

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Dashboard & Reporting

### Features to Add
- **Executive summary**: High-level security posture across all services
- **Trend analysis**: Security score changes over time
- **Risk prioritization**: Weighted risk scoring based on impact
- **Compliance mapping**: Map findings to compliance frameworks
- **Scheduled audits**: Automatic periodic assessments
- **Export capabilities**: PDF/CSV reports for stakeholders

### Implementation Plan
1. Design expandable UI framework
2. Create modular reporting components
3. Implement data storage for historical tracking
4. Add compliance mapping database
5. Build scheduler for automated assessments

## Technical Requirements
- Enhanced API token permissions (account-level access)
- Long-term storage for trend analysis
- Backend database for configuration history
- Improved authentication for the dashboard
- Rate limiting consideration for bulk operations

## Initial Zero Trust Checks to Implement

1. **ZT-ACCESS-001**: Verify MFA is required for all Access applications
   - Severity: HIGH
   - Remediation: Enable MFA for all Access apps

2. **ZT-ACCESS-002**: Check for appropriate session durations
   - Severity: MEDIUM
   - Remediation: Set session duration to 8 hours maximum for standard apps

3. **ZT-ACCESS-003**: Verify device posture checks are implemented
   - Severity: HIGH
   - Remediation: Enable at least basic device posture checks

4. **ZT-ACCESS-004**: Check for "Allow All" policies
   - Severity: HIGH
   - Remediation: Replace "Allow All" with specific inclusion policies

5. **ZT-ACCESS-005**: Verify Identity Provider security
   - Severity: CRITICAL
   - Remediation: Use secure IdP configurations with MFA support

6. **ZT-ACCESS-006**: Check for browser isolation on sensitive apps
   - Severity: MEDIUM
   - Remediation: Enable browser isolation for sensitive applications

7. **ZT-ACCESS-007**: Verify geo-restrictions on appropriate apps
   - Severity: MEDIUM
   - Remediation: Implement geo-restrictions for sensitive applications

8. **ZT-ACCESS-008**: Check for approval groups on critical applications
   - Severity: HIGH
   - Remediation: Implement approval workflows for critical app access
